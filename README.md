# Skin Lesion Classification and Segmentation using ResNet

This project implements skin lesion segmentation and classification using the ISIC dataset.  
It uses **ResNet-based models** for classification and includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts.

## ðŸ“Š Experiments & Results

We experimented with multiple deep learning architectures for skin lesion classification. Below are the brief results obtained:

Classification (ISIC 2019)
Model	    Validation Accuracy	                    Remarks
ResNet50	    ~50% (AUC ~0.73)	   Multi-label setup struggled due to class imbalance.
ResNet101	        80%	              Achieved the best performance among classifiers.
ResNet152	        75%	              Slightly lower than ResNet101,likely due to overfitting.

Segmentation (ISIC 2018)

Model	Validation Accuracy	                 Remarks
U-Net	    90%	                    Effectively segmented skin lesion regions.

âœ… Best classifier: ResNet101 (80%)
âœ… Best segmentation model: U-Net (90%)
